              <p>Travel by Design, a trip planner assistant, is a mobile application that our external sponsor, Lyndea Dew, had assigned our group to complete in 10 weeks. Travel by Design’s goal is to help make the process of planning a trip less overwhelming. When planning a trip, there are often many factors involved: tours to go on, museums to visit, shopping venues to shop at, trails to hike, and cultural spots that can’t be missed.</p>

                <p>Doodle is an online scheduling site which allows users to create polls and schedule meetings at specific times. Throughout the process, I extensively worked with Doodle and gathered some of the most pertinent problems in the site through research including user interviews and usability tests. The research has been used to redesign key aspects of the site in order to increase user satisfaction.</p>

                <p>A quick project that focuses on improving the Electronic Arts (EA) website to reorganize important sections shown on the main page.The first half of the page now showcases the latest games Electronic Arts has created. This makes the page more compact and to the point. The next focus is on the news. It now has a section with circular icons to contrast the rectangular carousel of game titles at the top with a More button that will redirect the user to the News page.</p>
