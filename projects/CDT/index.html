      <ol>
        <li class="regular">While Divi and Elementor are extremely similar, there were certain nuances for each of the
          platforms that were difficult to overcome.</li>
        <li class="regular">The original CDT website had 5 years worth of conference data that was either not being
          shown or severely outdated in appearance. The site lacked consistency in its pages as the years
          progressed which made the site look unpolished.</li>

      <h3>User Flow</h3>
