            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Assure is a mobile application and wearable that addresses concerns of sexual harassment. If you’ve ever
                felt wary walking out at night by yourself, unsure of how to protect yourself from a harasser, or want a
                space to communicate with others who’ve gone through similar situations, Assure aims to provide
                solutions to address these very problems. Currently, there is a lack of resources as well as support
                available for individuals who may be at risk or who have experienced some form of sexual harassment.
                This
                product aims to fill that gap by providing a set of features that help a user to prevent, protect, and
                recover from incidents of sexual harassment.</p>

                We found that there were gaps within our initial prototype and overall design. We uncovered pain points
                as well as unintuitive
                flows through prototypes and user testing. Some gaps included the lack of a panic button on the mobile
                device as well as a space
                for the
                user’s personal information. Four our MVP design, we addressed the latter by adding in the Profiles tab
                a section that housed information surrounding the user’s forum engagements (comments, liked posts,
                responses) as well as their incidents and reports. We also added in a panic button on mobile that could
                be pressed anytime during the user’s trip. Following our first iteration and tests, we updated the
                reporting flow to better distinguish between creating reports from scratch and from a recorded incident.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>A user interview is a UX research method where a designer/researcher learns about the users understanding
                of the topic, goals, challenges, behaviors and/or habits. It’s a way for designers to tap into the
                user’s feet and be able to empathize with them.
            </p>
            <h4>Research Implementation</h4>
            <p>We started by defining our goals for the interview. These included: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To understand people's conceptualization of harassment</li>
                <li>To find out what measures people currently take when thgey feel unsafe</li>
                <li>To see waht actions they would want to take under such circumstances</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We created a list of questions we wanted to ask the interviewees that would help us address our goals.
                For example, we asked: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have you ever felt afraid of going out on your own? When? Why?</li>
                <li>What protective measures do your normally take?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Findings</h4>
            <p>We used affinity diagramming in order to cateogorize and identify trends among the responses. The key
                takeaways were:</p>

            <h3>Surveys</h3>
            <p>Surveys consist of specific sets of questions and are requested to be filled out by a representative set
                of users. It is used by UX researchers/designers to understand the problem space better and gain
                quantitative information that can be used to draw insights along with qualitative data from interviews.

            </p>
            <h4>Research Implementation</h4>
            <p>We started by defining goals and creating a list of questions for the survey. The questions on the survey
                were broken down into 3 sections - General Info, Personal Experience and Witnessing. Questions included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How safe do you feel to walk alone during the day/night?</li>
                <li>If you have experienced sexual harassment, where did it take place? (optional — feel free to omit
                    this if you are not comfortable)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- ADD GRAPHS -->
