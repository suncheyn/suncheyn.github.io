            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Assure is a mobile application and wearable that addresses concerns of sexual harassment. If you’ve ever
                felt wary walking out at night by yourself, unsure of how to protect yourself from a harasser, or want a
                space to communicate with others who’ve gone through similar situations, Assure aims to provide
                solutions to address these very problems. Currently, there is a lack of resources as well as support
                available for individuals who may be at risk or who have experienced some form of sexual harassment. Our
                product aims to fill that gap by providing a set of features that help a user to prevent, protect, and
                recover from incidents of sexual harassment.</p>

            <p>
                We found that there were gaps within our initial prototype and overall design. We uncovered pain points
                as well as unintuitive
                flows through . Some gaps included the lack of a panic button on the mobile device as well as a space
                for the
                user’s personal information. Four our MVP design, we addressed the latter by adding in the Profiles tab
                a section that housed information surrounding the user’s forum engagements (comments, liked posts,
                responses) as well as their incidents and reports. We also added in a panic button on mobile that could
                be pressed anytime during the user’s trip. Following our first iteration and tests, we updated the
                reporting flow to better distinguish between creating reports from scratch and from a recorded incident
            </p>

                <u>Prevent</u> attacks from occuring in the first place using an interactive map that allows users to
                avoid potential unsafe areas using reports gathered from other Assure users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Protect</u> users by keeping others Keep others informed of where the user's location, and alerting
                them if things go south.

                <u>Recover</u> and heal. The community forum is a forum for individuals looking for a supportive
                environment to heal in or for individuals to find more information about ways to protect themselves or
                get justice and overall, just a place to connect with others and basically tackle the issue of sexual
                harassment together. Users can create posts, look and read through other posts and pages, as well as
                interact with other posts and users by commenting and liking posts and messages.
